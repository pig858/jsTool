# verifyTool
it's for everyone to varify the form or anything you want to check,
ill keep update it if i have new method to it:)
# how-to
download it and import .js file to your project
then you can use like this
if(!kaiVerifyTool.verifyNullString){
    //do false stuff
}else{
    //do true stuff
}
